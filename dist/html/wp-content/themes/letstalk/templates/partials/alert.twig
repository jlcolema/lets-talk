			<p>We recognise that this is a very challenging time for many and we are working hard to ensure that everyone gets as much as support as they need.</p>

			<p>We prioritise our client and staff safety and are closely following government and NHS guidelines aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19.</p>

			<p>Due to this, we have made some changes to how we deliver psychological support in our services.</p>

			<p>We offer assessment and treatment sessions by telephone, video or online support. We are currently able to offer only a limited number of face-to-face appointments. Therefore, we would strongly encourage individuals to try our telephone and video sessions first so that we are able to keep face-to-face appointments for those who are unable to attend remotely for medical or other reasons.</p>

			<p>Please note that due to an increased volume of referrals to our service, our waiting times for treatment might be longer than usual. Thank you for your patience and understanding.</p>
